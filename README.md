# Project 2: Landing Page 
## Description

This is second project of the Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree course.
> "This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page." 

For this project I used the [starter HTML and CSS files](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) provided by Udacity and transformed this static page into an interactive one. 

I implemented the following features/made the following changes:
* The navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list
* When scrolling, current section is highlighted on the page
* When clicking a link, it will scroll smoothly to the right section
* In the navigation bar, the link of the current section is highlighted and a :star: is added to the link text
* Using flexbox, I changed the layout of the navigation bar for small screens (mobile)
* I changed the existing background gradient colors
